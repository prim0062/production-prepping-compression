# Production prepping & compression

## Overview

- **GitHub isn’t needed for this assignment.**

  Think about how the website should be coded, looking at the wireframe in Illustrator, and pick it apart into the right exportable graphics.
- You should finish with a series of AIs, PSDs, SVGs, & JPGs exported & smushed in the proper folders.
